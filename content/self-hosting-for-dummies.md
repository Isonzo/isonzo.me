## So, you wanna be a strong and independent web dev who doesn't need no hosting service?
Well, although I would always encourage taking the this path for the independence or for the joy of learning, sometimes you just wanna _see_ the results **ASAP**, and unfortunately a hosting service is the most immediate solution.
But what if you don't want to shell out your hard-earned cash on hosting? What if you could rather spend something infinitely more _expendable_, like your time and general well-being?

Jokes aside, self-hosting is pretty satisfying once you finally get it down, and it's a nice little skill to have in your repertoire should you ever have to deal with making some sort of internal web tool in your company some time in the future.
At the very least, it'll make you appreciate hosting services more for the convenience and ease of use they offer.
