A card game my dearest grandmother showed me how to play, never learnt its name (she doesn't know what it's called), and I _constantly_ have to ask her the rules again since I don't have the opportunity to play it often.
Now I finally decided to write it down!

### Objective of the Game
There will be an specific goal to complete, a particular pattern of cards that you must get in your hand.
Once you fulfill those goal requirements, you place those cards face up and you try to get rid of the cards left in your hand by extending the pattern through all the cards face up on the table.
Round ends when someone is out of cards, any cards left give you points.
Person with least amount of points wins (like Golf!).

### Requirements
* Two decks of cards
* Pen and paper
* Two to four players

### How to play
1. Shuffle the two decks of cards together, and give each player **12 cards**.
2. Place a card face-up in the middle.
3. The player to right of the one who shuffled and dealt the cards begins.
4. Each turn you first draw a card from either the face-down pile or the face-up pile.
5. Then you check to see if you have fulfilled the current round's goal.
6. If you have, place the cards making up the goal face up in front of you, grouped up accordingly.
7. If you have already fulfilled the goal and you still have cards in your hand, you may try to _"find a place"_ for them.
8. You may not _"find a place"_ the same turn you've fulfilled the goal.
9. If you run out of cards by making each one of the _"find their place"_, you win the round. tally up scores.
10. Regardless of what you've done previously, before ending your turn you must place a card of your choosing from your hand into the face-up pile.
11. It is now the player to your right's turn.

### Goals
You play 7 rounds total.
You play the following rounds in order:
* 2 trios
* 1 trio and 1 staircase
* 2 staircases
* 2 trios and 1 staircase
* 1 trio and 2 staircases
* Either 4 trios or 3 staircases

To make a trio you simply need **3** cards with the same number/letter.  
To make a staircase it has to be **4** contiguous cards of the same suit.

**Note:** The number **'2'** counts as a wild card, and you can substitute it for any suit or number/letter.

### "Finding a place for card".
"Finding a place" meaning continuing the fulfilled cards (cards face-up due to being used to fulfill the current goal).
That means that if someone put down a trio and a staircase (as in round 2), and you've also fulfilled the goal by putting down a trio and a staircase, you may try to match the cards with either your own fulfilled cards or your opponents fulfilled cards.

In the case of trios, you simply have to place down a matching number/letter.  
In the case of staircases, you have to continue the staircase, and have it be of the same suit.
Staircases may wrap round (go from A down to K, and vice versa)
The number 2 still counts as a wild card.

### Scoring
The game is like golf.
**Lowest score wins.**
You count all cards in your hand.
Examples of cards that are **not** in your hand include the fulfilled cards and the cards that found their place.  
_Here are the values for each card:_   
* 3 - 10 = 5 points
* J Q K = 10 points
* A = 15 points
* 2 = 20 points

Score is tallied immediately after a player has no cards in their hands.
That player would have a score of **0**.
Write down the results for the round and move on to the second round.
Repeat until the final round, and sum up the points for each player.  
**Lowest amount wins.**
