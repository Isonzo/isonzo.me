# Motivation
So I decided to join the **"Godot Wild Jam #49"**, which had as a main theme **"Unstable"**.
The biggest requirement for the jam is using the Godot game engine, for which I'm using version 3.5.
So the first thing to do is to think of a game idea to execute.

My first idea was of unstable _structures,_ something along the lines of your main character having to defeat enemies in a building that took damage from both your attacks and the enemies attacks, and would collapse on you in different ways if supports failed.
It seemed promising, but it was just an idea in the idea board.
Then, expanding on that idea, I thought about giving the protagonist an explosive weapon in a building made of RigidBodies.
Although it was fun to think about, I had a feeling it would be too janky as I didn't have great experiences with Godot's RigidBody system.

The second idea was about unstable _movement_.
I got that after slacking off and being reminded of the existence of the Crypt of the NecroDancer.
Of course, it initially seems like the opposite of unstable, as it depends on moving to a very stable beat.
But it eventually led to me thinking about interesting movement mechanics, as that game was basically a dungeon crawler with its movement swapped by something non-traditional.
Following that line of thought, I remember those little Bennet Foddy style games, one of which was PogoStuck.  
Why not have something like that?
